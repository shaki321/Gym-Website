    <p><h2><strong>Nutrition</strong></h2></p>
    <p>"Nutrition is a critical part of health and development". Significant studies and evidence show that a balanced nutritional diet provides improved health for all ages, stronger imumne system, safer pregnancy and childbirth, lower risk of communicable diseases (such as diabetes and cardivascular diseases), and most importantly longevity.</p>
    
    <p>Children with a balanced diet of healthy foods learn better. Sufficient nutrition allow people to be more productive both mentally and physically.</p>
    
    <p>A lack of nutrition (called malnutrition), presents a threat to human health. Today's world faces two global problems; malnutrition in low and middle income countries and overeating in high income countries.</p>
    
    <p>As each country population continue to grow, the demand of food continues to rise. The convinience of fast food, takeaway and processed food seem inevitable.
    <p>So how do we address this issue? First, STOP eating fast food, takeaway and processed food.</p>

    <p>In this journey, you will realise its all about discipline. That means; NO snacking, staying proactive and being 100% commited to your cause!</p>

    <p>It is important to highlight the key nutritional ingredients within food:</p>
    <p>Carbohydrates</p>
        <p>Come in simple and complex forms. Simple carbohydrates are digested quickly and send immediate bursts of glucose into the blood stream. Complex carbohydrates are digested more slowly and supply a lower more steady release of glucose into the blood stream. There are three different types of carbohydrates: sugars, starch and fibre each with their own benefits.</p>
    <p>Proteins</p>
        <p>Are made up of small units called amino acids, which attach to one another forming long chains. Your body uses these amino acids to build and repair muscles and bones. They also make hormones and enzymes.</p>
    <p>Fats</p>
        <p>Come in three forms; saturated, unsaturated and trans-fats. Fats are an essential source of fatty acids, which helps to absorb vitamin A, D and E. These vitamins are fat-soluble, which means they can only be absorbed with the help of fats.</p>
    <p>salts</p>
    <p>minerals</p>
    <p>vitamins</p>
