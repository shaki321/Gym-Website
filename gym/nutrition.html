    <p><h2><strong>Nutrition</strong></h2></p>
    <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) describes nutrition as "a critical part of health and development". Significant studies and evidence show that a balanced nutritional diet provides improved health for all ages, stronger imumne system, safer pregnancy and childbirth, lower risk of communicable diseases (such as diabetes and cardivascular diseases), and most importantly longevity.</p>
    
    <p>A lack of nutrition (called malnutrition), presents a threat to human health. Today's world faces two global problems; malnutrition in low and middle income countries and overeating in high income countries.</p>
    
    <p>A countries population continues to grow exponentially, the demand of food continues to rise. The availability and convinience of fast food, takeaway and processed food seem inevitable.</p>
    <p>So how do we address this issue? First, STOP eating fast food, takeaway and processed food.</p>

    <p>In this journey, you will realise its all about discipline. Whether you want to be lean (slim), strong (strongman) or want to look good (body builder).</p> 
    
    <p>The journey starts by understanding your goals first. If you want to be slim and lean you want to eat moderately based on your daily intake requirements. However, this rule solely depends on your daily life style as well. This could include; going to the gym, playing social sports, being proactive and even working. That means you may have to; limit the amount of snacking, staying proactive and being 100% commited to your cause!</p>

    <p>It is important to highlight the key nutritional ingredients within food:</p>
  
    <p>Carbohydrates</p>
        <p>Come in simple and complex forms. Simple carbohydrates are digested quickly and send immediate bursts of glucose into the blood stream. Complex carbohydrates are digested more slowly and supply a lower more steady release of glucose into the blood stream. There are three different types of carbohydrates: sugars, starch and fibre each with their own benefits.</p>
 
     <p>Proteins</p>
        <p>Are made up of small units called amino acids, which attach to one another forming long chains. Your body uses these amino acids to build and repair muscles and bones. It is important to understand that they also contribute to hormones and enzymes production within your <body>
            
    <p>Fats</p>
        <p>Come in three forms; saturated, unsaturated and trans-fats. Fats are an essential source of fatty acids, which helps to absorb vitamin A, D and E. These vitamins are fat-soluble, which means they can only be absorbed with the help of fats. Fat is stored in your liver and and body fat.</p>
        
    <p>Salts</p>
        <p>Plays a crucial role in maintaining human health. Sodium Chloride (Table Salt) is essential for nerve and muscle function and also helps to regulate fluids in the body.</p>

    <p>Minerals</p>
        <p>Have 3 main reasons; build strong bones and teeth, controlling body fluids inside and outside cells and turning the food you eat into energy. Some examples of minerals include: calcium, iron, copper etc...</p>

    <p>Vitamins</p>
        <p>There are 2 types of vitamin, fat-soluble and water-soluble. The following vitamins are fat-soluble; vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E and vitamin K. Some examples of water-soluble vitamins include; vitamin C, vitamin B1, vitamin B2, vitamin B3, vitamin B6, vitamin B7, vitamin B12 and folic acid. Each vitamin has an important function. For example, vitamin A supports the immune system to fight infections, support your vision in dim light conditions and keeping your skin healthy.</p>
